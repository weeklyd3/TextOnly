// Title: Compiling Assembly
What's machine code?
The answer: Here's a bit:
MZ¬ê       √ø√ø  ¬∏       @                                   √†   ¬∫ ¬¥	√ç!¬∏L√ç!This program cannot be run in DOS mode.

Sure looks like some gibberish.

Answer: Not gibberish. It's gibberish to you but not gibberish
to the machine. Welcome to the land of binary code.

So every program on my computer is gibberish?

Answer: To you, yes. That --^ was doskey.com. This is cmd.exe:
MZ¬ê       √ø√ø  ¬∏       @                                   √∞   ¬∫ ¬¥	√ç!¬∏L√ç!This program cannot be run in DOS mode.

I see a bit: "This program cannot be run in DOS mode." Is this
for me?

Answer: Alas, no. This is for warnings when starting with DOS:
"This program cannot be run in DOS mode." gets printed out to
the screen. That's not code, it's a string.

Cotton? Wool?

Answer: NO! This is a string in programming, which is a block of
text.

THEN NOW, HOW DO I WRITE COMPUTER PROGRAMS? LEARN MACHINE GIBBERISH?

Answer: No! You don't have to! Does this:
; start of code
; this is a hello world.
    global  _main
    extern  _printf

    section .text
_main:
    push    message
    call    _printf
    add     esp, 4
    ret
message:
    db  'Hello, World', 10, 0
Look better?

Better than "MZ¬ê       √ø√ø  ¬∏       @                                   √∞   ¬∫ ¬¥	√ç!¬∏L√ç!This program cannot be run in DOS mode."

But how about print('hello world')? That's easier!

Answer: Easy for you, harder for the Python authors. What's happening:
1. The interpreter reads the file.
2. 'hello world' is converted into binary. 0101010100101010101!
3. The binary is loaded into your RAM. So it now looks like this:
01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100000 01110111 01101111 01110010 01101100 01100100
4. The machine prints it out, so you get
+---------------------+
| hello world         |
|                     |
|                     |
+---------------------+
and the program exits.

So how do I get this to print without Assembly?

Answer: any low level programming language works.
C:
#include "stdio.h"
int main(void) {
  printf("hello world");
